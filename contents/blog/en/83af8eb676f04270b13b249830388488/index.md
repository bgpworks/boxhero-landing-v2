## Why Use Barcodes?

Why do all retail stores scan barcodes before making a payment? It is all because of 'efficiency.' Employees need to process a transaction quickly with an accurate calculation at the checkout counter. However, if you have items without barcodes attached, the count must be done manually along with checking the price. Considering how most supermarkets or convenience stores hold thousands of products, remembering all these products wouldn't make any sense.

Not only do barcodes hold product data, but it also allows you to leave transaction in a system. You can see many businesses using a POS(Point of Sales) when checking out the products. **This is not only a great system for transacting payment faster but also gathers all information for how many products have been sold for sales management.** Surprisingly, this is all possible thanks to barcodes.

This can apply to different types of businesses. If you are having trouble with tracking inventory and collecting sales analysis, let an [inventory system](https://www.boxhero-app.com/en/) do it for you. From generating barcodes to sales analysis, it can all be done in one.

## How to Make Barcodes

Barcodes are actually just a combination of numbers (and sometimes texts) that don't contain any information. The main purpose of a barcode is to grant a unique number for each product and then create a database based on barcodes with the use of machines. Therefore, barcodes can be in any order of digits. For example, if there are 100 different kinds of bread, you can randomly generate a barcode number from 1 to 100 for each bread.

On BoxHero, an inventory management system, you can easily generate random barcodes if your products don't have one, such as handmade products.

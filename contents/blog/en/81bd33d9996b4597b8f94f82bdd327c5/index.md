## What is CLV?

Customer lifetime value(CLV) is the total value that a customer has engaged in a business. In short, it’s a calculation of how much a customer has spent entirely. Therefore, in an eCommerce business, CLV is one of the key metrics for various activities such as advertisement budget, marketing campaign, customer acquisition investment, and more.

## Why is CLV important?

As mentioned above, it can play an important role when planning and evaluating various activities. It can also indicate whether your business is growing, who your loyal customers are, and even provide insights on how to increase your business’ profit. With such information, you can plan and create various marketing activities and build better customer relations, increasing CLV even more.

CLV can also be helpful when you wish to find insights from different customer segmentations. By looking into the customer’s activity and finding the pattern from both segments from customers in the low and high value of CLV, you can find insights into how to draw more sales from both groups.

1. **Better Marketing Strategy**<br/>You may have heard of KPI often, especially at the beginning of building a marketing strategy. KPI stands for Key Performance Indicator that helps to measure if the objective is being successfully achieved.  For an eCommerce business, CLV can be one of the KPIs especially when it comes to marketing.

2. **Less Customer Acquisition Cost**<br/>CAC, which is a Customer Acquisition Cost, is a cost spent to acquire a customer to purchase your product. The lower the acquisition cost, the better it is for your business and one of the tactics to lower the CAC is by increasing the CLV.

3. **More Sales**<br/>Many businesses focus on acquiring new customers, but although new acquisitions are important, generating more sales from your usual customer is also another thing you should add to your checklist. New customers have to get to know your brand, sign up, enter their address..the process of getting to know each other is tough in customer relations as well. But with customers who have already made several purchases are more fond of your brand and are likely to purchase your products based on the trust built towards the brand. With the CLV, you can plan out marketing strategies and differentiate the plan by the lower, higher CLV customer base. With such repeated sales, your CLV will increase over time as well.

4. **Customer Loyalty**<br/>In our card wallets, we not only hold our debit or credit cards but also membership cards from various stores and markets we frequently visit. It goes the same with the apps on our smartphones. Various membership apps from online to B&M stores are stacked on our smartphones. Such memberships are actually one of the ways to increase customer loyalty as well as the CLV. One of the ways is to segment your customers by the amount they’ve spent and create membership programs in levels. By this, you can run marketing campaigns for both customers with low and high LTV to engage in your site with different levels of rewards.

3. **Average Customer Lifetime**<br/>Lastly, the average customer lifetime lets you know the average time they shop in your store by year. Find the first and last order date from all your customers and convert that to the number of days on average. Then, divide that number by 365.

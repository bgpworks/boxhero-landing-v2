## Why is Inventory Management Important in Pharmacies?

If a customer cannot find the drug they are looking for, there's a high chance that the customer will go to the next drugstore they can find. There's an even higher chance that they may never come back the next time they need their medicines. If you think about it, no one writes their name down on a waiting list for a medicine. It's a matter of emergency. So what can we do to avoid these situations? For pharmacies, it's crucial to keep a steady amount of quantity as well as to conduct an inventory count routinely. 

Inventory management not only allows you to save time by keeping track of what items are in stock but also allows you to know what items need to be reordered in advance. Building this system helps you to grow a great customer relationship in two ways: having stock and knowing when stocks will come in. Customers aren't always mad about stockout, they get mad when it's never in stock. If you can manage a great inventory system and even get to keep track of your item's lead time, you can provide when items will be available again and this can allow you to build a strong customer relationship based on trust. 

## 3 Tips on Efficiently Managing Pharmaceutical Supplies

So, let's get into where we can start to build that strong customer relationship.

An automated system allows increasing the credibility of your inventory data. It's like a calculator. Even it's adding and subtracting simple numbers, repetition done by humans can cause errors. Rather than counting and writing your inventory on paper, scan all barcodes and let machines do the counting for you.

**2. Categorize your Inventory**<br/>
Separating bookshelves by the genres in the library not only allows visitors to find books they are looking for, but also allows the librarians to check how many books are available for each genre. In inventory control, categorization is crucial as it not only allows you to learn more about your inventory but also lets you know how many stocks are available for each category.

For example, if you categorize and sort your inventory by brand, you can immediately check the most and the least amount of stocks that are available for each brand. From here, the analysis goes on. For example, you can analyze by the date to check which brand is most popular at a certain season and prepare for restock next year.

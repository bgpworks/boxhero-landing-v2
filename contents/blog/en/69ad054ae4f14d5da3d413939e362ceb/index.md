## What’s Important in Ecommerce Inventory Management

The market of Ecommerce has continuously grown not only in the size but also in type as well. Although Amazon is one of the largest Ecommerce platforms, with handmade and used markets like Etsy and eBay or Ecommerce platforms like Shopify or BigCommerce, not only the buyer but also the number of online sellers has grown.

Especially after the pandemic, converting from brick and mortar to online business may have been a decision that had to be made for some businesses. But regardless of online or in-store, running a business is not easy. If you are selling products, it’s even harder since you have to manage the stock and inventory as well.

Today, let’s learn about how to manage inventory for Ecommerce businesses and some of the most efficient ways to control your stocks before getting shipped out for order placement.

## What is Ecommerce inventory management?

Like managing stocks for in-store inventory, Ecommerce inventory management also requires reordering, controlling quality, counting inventory, except you must ship your products to your customer in an Ecommerce business. For traditional brick and mortar, shipping occurs when receiving and placing your product on your shelf, whereas delivering the product to each customer must be considered in the online store.

It’s important to always keep shipment in mind for online businesses because this directly correlates to customer satisfaction. As we commonly do when we shop online, customer review greatly affect sales.

## 3 Reasons why Ecommerce Inventory Management is Important

1. **Customer Satisfaction**<br/>Since online store lacks customer relationship compared to in-store shop, it’s important to maintain customer trust. Thus, one of the important factors in building customer trust would be order management, or in other words, having customers receive their package as soon as possible. Because online shopping requires customers to pay first, it’s important to minimize the amount of waiting time of the buyer. Considering how shipping also takes time, it’s important to manage orders and have optimal inventory quantity at all times.

2. **Save Time, Save Money**<br/>If you have to rummage through your stocks every time a new order is placed, it’s a sign of an emergency. From managing orders to checking the shipment, an Ecommerce business needs constant overview and checking. Therefore, by starting inventory management, you can not only save more time but save money as well by doing other activities that can help your business such as building and practicing marketing strategies.

3. **Streamlining Your Business** <br/>Although many businesses neglect inventory management, it’s important to start inventorying to streamline and increase the efficiency of your business. By organizing and knowing which product must be ordered when, you can start to plan out your week, month, and year for your business. From here, you can also start marketing and promotional strategies to boost up your sales.

## Recommended Ecommerce Inventory Management Strategies

1. **Adopt Barcode**<br/>You may think barcodes are needed for managing and selling manufactured items, but barcodes can be applied to many types of businesses to help streamline the business. If your products don’t have barcodes, you can make one and attach a barcode label to the product. This way, you can not only assign unique code to each product but can also use a barcode scanner to make your work faster and easier.

2. **Analyze your Inventory** <br/>Knowing how many stocks are in your inventory and making shipments is one thing, but analyzing and getting to know your inventory better is the next step to the actual inventory management. Identifying your inventory information like reorder time or optimal stock level is useful data for planning inventory.

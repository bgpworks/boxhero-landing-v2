Our company encountered difficulties in tracking business assets as it required lots of effort to find them. We knew that the only solution for this problem was to manage them properly to protect our business’s profit. However, our company decided not to process manual asset management since it can bring us inconvenience and gives wrong information and data.

Therefore, we chose to get the help of asset management software to save time and focus on other necessary works. We recorded everything happening to our assets since it is crucial to know their status as it betters decision-making in investing. If your business relates to the challenges we have experienced, this blog will eventually help you manage business assets effectively with BoxHero.

Look at some of the top challenges and ways to overcome them in a business.

## Challenges in the Absence of Asset Management System

These are some of the challenges that we have experienced while managing assets without any system.

<br/>

- **Human Error**

Our company had difficulties finding and distinguishing similar assets, and these challenges sometimes lead to human errors. It took us lots of time and effort to track them since there were no asset images in the record. However, we chose not to manage assets manually since there is a higher chance of providing inaccurate data in the document. Specifically, companies can encounter some mistakes in the operation and calculation because of confusion in identifying assets. These mistakes can cause having inaccurate data, and it will be complicated for you to track business assets when errors occur.

<br/>

- **Lack of Inventory Count**

At first, we did not process any inventory count since we had few assets in the office. However, not performing inventory count leads to having an inaccurate quantity of current assets. Especially when the number of assets increased, it was difficult to manage them properly, and we had no idea which assets were available or not. With this, our company experienced having ghost assets and low stock of assets which can directly impact businesses for the reasons such as unrecorded stock out, asset rearrangement, and others. When we started to process inventory count without any system, the same problems occurred in the record.

<br/>

- **Inappropriate Tracking**

As the number of assets increases, tracking them without software becomes more difficult since you need to find them on a long list. It always took us lots of time to keep track of them as our company had more than 100 papers of asset lists. Moreover, searching for the needed assets in that paper was challenging as we had to find out where it is, who's using them, etc. In this case, you have to keep in mind that if you track your assets inappropriately, you will be recording the wrong information and have inaccurate data.

How do you run a business well? Some may say an excellent marketing, competitive sales team, or even great lighting in your store. Among various tactics to raise your sales, there is one that is quite unexpected, which is **dead stock**.

Retailers have many challenges when it comes to running a business and one of those frustrations include dead stock. In [inventory management](https://www.boxhero-app.com/en/blog/posts/what-is-inventory-management), knowing how many stocks to reorder requires data analysis, business experience, and customer awareness. Without such expertise, it's easy to end with dead stock which can negatively affect your sales and cash flow. Moreover, dead stock also takes up valuable warehouse space and acts as a bad investment for your company. In this article, we will go more over the reason why a dead stock is bad for your business and the ways to avoid them.

## What is Dead Stock?

Dead stock is also known as obsolete/dead inventory, which also refers to an inventory that is unsold and has a low possibility to be sold in the future as well. Usually, dead stocks are kept in a warehouse or retail business' stockroom. If dead stocks aren't repurposed regularly, it will lead to a company's money loss. Considering how stocks must be purchased, shipped, stored, and taken care of, it's not only the number of items that you sell that affects your business. It's also how well you manage your inventory.

## Why is Dead Stock Bad for Your Business?

Dead stock involves a large inventory cost, which can easily hurt your business. Let's dive deeper into how it's bad for your business.

- **Money Loss**<br/>
  The main reason that dead stock is bad for your business is that it usually results in money loss. The company recoups its inventory investment by selling its products. However, in the case of dead stock, you won't be able to make a profit on the product which you have invested in.
- **Holding Cost**<br/>
  Keeping an unsold product comes with its holding costs and expenses. In addition, holding costs are normally covered by income earned from product sales. However, if you aren't selling anything, there will be no such revenue.
- **Lost Opportunity Cost**<br/>
  There is an opportunity cost associated with the accumulation of dead stock since it takes up space that could be used to manage other items that can be more profitable. Therefore, you will be missing a chance to store and sell a top-selling item by storing dead stock on your shelves.
- **Increased Employee Wages**<br/>
  The more inventory on the shelves, the more work is needed to keep track of everything. Dead stock can result in increased employee wages due to increased maintenance required to handle excess inventory.

## 3 Ways to Avoid Dead Stock

- **Ensure product's quality**<br/>
  When you have too many dead stocks, it may be due to an issue with your item. Are the items good quality or are there any damages? Have you gone through the proper quality assurance process? Dead stock is frequently caused by a lack of quality control. Customers won't re-purchase your items if they had a dissatisfying experience. Establish a proper quality assurance process before mass manufacturing or order in bulk to guarantee that the raw materials you use and the goods you sell to customers have no damage or issues.
- **Collect customer's needs**<br/>
  Check your customer reviews from people who have purchased the product and see what that feedback states. It may help you to learn the reasons for your dead stock. If there is an issue with how the goods are manufactured, you may need to rethink your supplier partners.

  You'll be better positioned to avoid dead stock if you know what buyers need and want. Before investing in new items, conduct market research by creating customer surveys. Also, continuously collect customer feedback when you begin selling new products; the findings may alert you to possible issues that might lead to future dead stock.

- **Start inventory management system**<br/>
  Nearly half of the small businesses either use a manual inventory method or do not track their inventories. If you are one of those small businesses, try to improve your inventory management by investing in a solution that will help you make better decisions and minimize your dead stock.
